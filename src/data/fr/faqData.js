    question: "What is an NFT?",
    answerList: [

    question: "Is an NFT really useful?",
    answerList: [
      "The term NFT has been used for a very short time and is often compared to an image with no other use. In reality an NFT is a technology that offers solutions that were not possible to have before its existence. An NFT simply ensures the authenticity of a digital asset and secures its sale or purchase. The usefulness of an NFT is not based on the technology but rather on the way it is used.",
